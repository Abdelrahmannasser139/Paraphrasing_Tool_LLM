# Paraphrasing_Tool_LLM

# Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a paraphrasing tool designed to leverage the advanced capabilities of LLaMA models (1B, 3B, and 8B) for high-quality document rewriting. The tool employs prompt engineering techniques to enhance paraphrasing accuracy, mitigate repetitive outputs, and address the challenges associated with fine-tuning large transformer-based models.

# Features

Multi-Scale Model Support: Utilizes LLaMA models of varying scales (1B, 3B, and 8B) to provide a balance between computational efficiency and paraphrasing quality.

Prompt Engineering: Implements iterative prompt design for improved paraphrasing coherence and reduced repetition.

High-Quality Outputs: Ensures semantic similarity, fluency, and grammatical accuracy in paraphrased text.

# Applications

The paraphrasing tool can be applied to various NLP tasks, including:

Content rewriting

Summarization

Plagiarism detection

# Methodology

1. Model Selection

LLaMA models of three scales were tested:

1B: Offers computational efficiency with moderate paraphrasing quality.

3B: Balances efficiency and output quality.

8B: Delivers the best paraphrasing performance, particularly for complex inputs.

2. Prompt Design

An iterative process was used to refine prompt configurations, optimizing for:

Semantic coherence

Fluency

Grammatical accuracy

3. Evaluation Metrics

Generated paraphrases were evaluated based on:

Semantic Similarity: Retaining the meaning of the original text.

Fluency: Ensuring natural language flow.

Grammatical Accuracy: Avoiding syntactic errors.

# Results

Improved Accuracy with Larger Models: The LLaMA 8B model consistently produced the most coherent and contextually accurate paraphrases.

Reduced Repetition: Prompt engineering significantly mitigated repetitive outputs.

Efficiency Considerations: While the 1B model is suitable for resource-constrained environments, the quality of outputs improved with larger models.

# Usage

Load the desired LLaMA model (1B, 3B, or 8B).

Input the text document you want to paraphrase.

Configure the prompt settings to optimize output quality.

Run the paraphrasing script to generate rewritten content.

# Limitations

Resource Requirements: Larger models like the 8B variant require significant computational resources.

Complex Inputs: While effective, paraphrasing of highly technical or ambiguous texts may still require manual refinement.

# Future Work

Explore fine-tuning techniques to further enhance model performance.

Incorporate additional evaluation metrics for robustness.

Develop a user-friendly GUI for non-technical users.
